# Soccer-League-Organizer

A console-based program used to organize and manage a youth soccer league. The program contains an example set of players.

Users can add teams, assign coaches, manage players, as well as automatically create teams based on fairness factors (height and previous experience). It also includes a report titled "Fairness Report" that calculates the equality of teams.
